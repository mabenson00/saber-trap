# Saber Trap

A neon-glow arcade game where you wield a two-sided lightsaber to build walls and trap a bouncing ball in the smallest area possible.

## How to Play

- **CLICK / F** — Slash (extend saber into a wall)
- **Q / E** — Rotate saber
- **1-4** — Snap to preset angles (Horizontal / Vertical / 45° / 135°)
- **SCROLL** — Fine rotation
- **SPACE** — Bank your score and end the round
- **P / ESC** — Pause
- **R** — Restart

## Rules

1. A ball bounces around the screen
2. Position your cursor in the unclaimed area and slash to create a wall
3. The saber extends from your cursor to the boundaries, creating a permanent wall
4. The side without the ball gets **claimed** (shaded blue)
5. If the extending saber touches the ball — **game over**
6. Press SPACE at any time to **bank** your score safely
7. Collect green powerups for help, avoid red ones (or don't!)

## Powerups

| Powerup | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Slow-Mo** (S) | Ball slows to 30% speed for 5s |
| **Freeze** (F) | Ball freezes for 3s |
| **Ghost Blade** (G) | Next slash passes through ball safely |
| **Shield** (D) | Survive one ball hit |
| **Speed Surge** (!) | Ball doubles speed for 5s |
| **Multi-Ball** (M) | Adds another ball permanently |
| **Phantom** (?) | Ball becomes semi-transparent for 8s |
| **Wall Rot** (X) | Destroys a random wall |

## Scoring

- **Area %** — Base score from claimed percentage
- **Efficiency** — Bonus for fewer walls used
- **Speed** — Bonus for faster completion
- **Combos** — Chain walls within 3s for multipliers
- **Close Calls** — Bonus for near-misses with the ball
